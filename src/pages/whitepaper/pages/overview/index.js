                The Red Ape Family (TRAF) is a ground-breaking new comedy show, and the first animated series in the known universe built around, and starring, NFTs. It is also the first show of its kind where episodes are sold as individual NFTs. The stars are all Bored Ape Yacht Club OGs, but other NFTs also feature throughout, both as characters and featured art. The project is all about bringing the NFT community together and exploding preconceptions of what is possible in this space.
