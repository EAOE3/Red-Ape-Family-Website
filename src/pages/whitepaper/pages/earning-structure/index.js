            <p className="is-size-5" style={{fontWeight: '400'}}>
                We don’t just want TRAF to exist and thrive in the NFT world. We’re also aiming to unlock vast global audiences by working with some of the world’s biggest streaming platforms. Naturally, we want our community to benefit from this.
                <br/><br/>
                For example – if Netflix or Amazon Prime agreed to host TRAF – we would share 25% of the streaming revenue with our token holders.

                If you are a first minter of a TRAF token, you get secondary sales royalties for life! That’s how much we’re willing to reward early adopters.
