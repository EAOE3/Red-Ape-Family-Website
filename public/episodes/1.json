  "description":"It’s 2130. The earth is dying. But all is not lost! Four Bored Apes. One dog. A Lazy Lion with a stethoscope. A mission to Mars.\r\n\r\nThe Red Ape Family is the first animated comedy series in the known universe built around and starring NFTs. It is also the first show of its kind where episodes are sold as NFTs.\r\n\r\nIn episode one, our heroes arrive in Muskville to start their new lives as ridiculously wealthy interplanetary art dealers. But all is not as it seems. Or is it even weirder than that?\r\n\r\nBuckle up and  go bananas for a new era in NFT, comedy, art and animation history!",
